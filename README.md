  ## Integer Language Design for Computational Purposes
  During this project, I learned the importance of working with people with a similar approach to things because it gets easier to start a sprint and continue. I am grateful to my teammates for that, as it was a joy to do this project alongside them.

  In terms of language design, I understood the design choices made in many languages, as it was challenging to define a programming language that is both readable, writeable, and is flexible enough to allow users to create complex programs but strongly typed enough not to let developers make unnoticed mistakes. After this project, I became a Java enthusiast; I am now grown enough to appreciate all the unnecessary-looking syntax.

  I can proudly say our project received the highest grade for the first part of our semester, 98, and we were able to make it a 100 in the second part of the project.
